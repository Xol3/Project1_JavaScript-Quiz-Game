IMPORTANT! Most of learning web development is applying the knowledge you’ve gained. It can feel very comfortable to keep pressing play and continue to watch tutorials and videos. In my experience, the most rapid learning has been achieved while struggling with an actual projects. It is important to dig into some code yourself, and build something with the skills you’ve learned to really let the learning take root! Please dont cheat your self and look for solution code as it will hinder the purpose of this project.

Project 1 - Small JavaScript Quiz Game

Objective: Create a Vanilla JavaScript/jQuery quiz game that takes multiple answers and shows a result to the user.

JavaScript Quiz Game. Start by creating a simple game that asks 4 multiple choice questions. Using those questions, assign them a value which will point to an outcome that will be displeyed on the DOM. You’ll learn a lot about data management and creating a scoring system in programming. Don’t spend too much time focusing on the design(CSS) of what you’re creating. Once you have built the logic leave the CSS to the very end.
